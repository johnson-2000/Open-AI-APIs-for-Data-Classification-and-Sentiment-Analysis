It’s evident what the motive is for this new update. I’ve used Spotify for YEARS, but I’m truly considering using whatever else I can find. This is imprisoning to say the least. A person is unable to do anything but shuffle and edit playlists—NOT EVEN PREVIEW THE SONG IN THE PLAYLIST WHICH THEY'RE EDITING!? I could build on my own playlists by looking at others with similar playlists. I would designate HOURS on just doing this; on building on my own playlists by discovering other songs in other playlists and PREVIEWING them. That was it’s charm!!! I loved previewing the songs I added, and I’d listen to how those couple of seconds matched to the other songs in my playlists. I’d also do the same on other peoples playlists, and by previewing songs I could decide which playlists I liked most and had the best songs. The thought of even trying to find other playlists when I can’t see ANYTHING on the playlist itself is a nightmare-fuel. To preview a song I have to add it to my favourited song section—so the ability is still there but now you have to take the longer way—which huh???? How does that make sense?? They’ve just made their users experience so much more miserable than need be. Good riddance, Spotify. Must money be the driving source ALWAYS? Does the experience of the non-paying users not matter??

It's like Spotify got the rights to peoples music (which they don't pay much for, another issue altogether), developed an AI that they let run wild and then just sat back and twiddled their thumbs..I honestly don't understand what the employees do. It seems like one intern with some coding skills could fix a majority of them issues. I think my biggest peeve is the lack of social interaction. Other than seeing what friends are listening to, there is virtually no social component. It would be way cooler to easily be able to get to my friends pages and go through their playlists and send songs back and forth etc, but spotify makes that incredibly difficult. Navigating anything on the site seems pretty miserable. People's homemade playlists were pretty cool for a while, but it is clear that spotify actively pushes these into the digital dust so that the Spotify-made playlists rise to the top. Some of them are good, but some seem totally half assed and sometimes have no sense of the genre they are supposed to be. Do we even know what the AI is doing at this point? Shuffle all of my songs which are mostly electronic and hiphop, okay let's play the 20 reggae tracks you have all in a row... hmm. Spotify Radio. Oh here's a bunch of songs you already like.

The non-authorized dialog means you have your library on multiple computers, apple music is much less forgiving than spotify when it comes to device sharing (almost a bigger con than the search thing). the song skipping is likely just the quality switching from regular to high or whatever.\\n\\nthis might also be a personal thing, but the desktop ui of Apple Music is soooooooooo hard to traverse compared to spotify. Why the hell is everything a hyperlink or hidden in a context menu, im on a computer, i want navigation buttons that follow me when i scroll! and by contrast why is there so much padding, it's so obvious they just sought to replicate the mobile ui (likely out of crunch, hooray swift ui).\\n\\nthe only truly *better* thing, imo, that makes any difference to consumers about apple music is the ability to integrate your local library with your streaming library, and even that is more of a hassle than its worth because you end up with a lot of duplicates and search still isn't seamless (you have to filter for your library as opposed to all of apple music because the search has 0 ability to store context).\\n\\ni guess there's also the higher royalty for artists, but like who cares if artists get paid more, no consumer has ever given a shit about that, they just want convenient ways of doing things. also the lossless thing, but unless you have a really solid home audio speaker setup that you can blare on the regular or you are djing using apple music (wtf), lossless audio is so low on the value to trouble scale.\\n\\ni switched mainly because my student discount on spotify ran out and i got a thicc gift card with the aforementioned m1 pro. oh well, i'll deal with the significantly shittier user experience if it's essentially free.\",\n",

Or force quitting the app. \\n\\nSkipping a beat does sometimes happen for me, because I do have it set to lossless, and I think it switches between codecs. I have created playlists where I downloaded those tracks locally and it has help eliminate that issue. \\n\\nI do use the macOS Music app heavily and it is a much improved solution over the prior iTunes app. I have no issue with this. The only annoyance I ran into for awhile, was that on the iOS app I could not delete Playlist folders. I had to do it on the Music app on the Mac and wait a few hours to sync those delete folders to iOS. Other than that, it runs great. \\n\\nThe “not authorized” issue used to occur with me, when I only had a single license of Apple Music. I tied my Apple Music app to my Alexa devices and HomePods, including the Apple TVs and if someone else requested to play anything on those devices I got the bounce.  I solved this issue by subscribing to Apple One. I no longer get those unauthorized messages anymore. \\n\\nTo round out my music experience further I am currently a subscriber to both Apple Music and SiriusXM. The DJs and actual radio station numbers make the music experience complete and alive. I use Apple Music to create playlists or instantly goto albums or tracks I hear on SiriusXM. I know Apple Music has radio too, but it is better organized on SiriusXM, it also brings people together at the same time verse on-demand. I equate having both music streamers equivalent to having more than one game console, I have the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. Both are uniquely different vs. having both XBOX and PlayStation since they are very similar in nature. \\n\\nMy iPhone is the 14 Pro Max with 1TB and my Mac is the MacBook Pro 16” M1 Max. I do have a Pixel 6a and the Music app isn’t as clean as it is on iOS and missing features, but it does perform well on that device too. \\n\\nFor me, Apple Music is nicely integrated into the Apple ecosystem I decided to go with. I also love using Shazam and this is also part of Apple Music.  The live lyrics nails it. I love Spatial Audio, game charger. I love that you can isolate the voice on tracks. That’s killer.  Where it falls short for me is that I want to customize more of a homepage, better follows. My vibe and not too much of Apple Music pushing genres I don’t care about. Lift SiriusXM a little for better radio programming. DJs matter. They bring a great freshness to music. And I love that Apple Music sits here in America, right here in my backyard in Culver City. So I love that it is local to my country too. \\n\\nApple Music is really driven by the Album, whereas Spotify is playlist specific. \\n\\nAnd I also like that Apple did breakout the Podcasts, TV, Movies, AudioBooks onto their own apps, vs. Spotify doing what Apple did over 15 years ago by pushing all content into one app. Keep it separate. Apple finally got that right. For Windows’ users who still uses iTunes, well expect changes soon in that direction. The Music App for Windows is coming soon. \\n\\nFinally a couple of things Apple Music needs help on is the social aspect and scheduling events and easily syncing your calendar to them. I would love to see a way to purchase live events directly from the artist themselves, and the tickets drop into Apple Wallet. So a lot of improvements need to be made. Far from perfect, but it will get there. \\n\\nAnyway I hope you optimize your listening experience too. It is great when you find that balance between tech and art.',\n",

       " \"- More users, meaning better use of social features\\n- Better APIs and services, meaning more integrations on different devices than anyone else\\n- Better music curation algorithm, and being the first to make interesting products with the algorithm (like Discovery Weekly & Release Radar)\\n\\nApple Music has lossless and HiRes, has better integration with Apple devices, has music videos, lyrics, live radio stations (and a music video channel that they don't promote/is hard to find). None of that has overcome Spotify's first mover advantage.\\n\\nThat said, Apple Music has put Spotify in a vice. Apple can keep paying high royalties. Spotify can't. Apple can afford to include Lossless and HiRes in its main plan. Spotify can't, as evidenced by Spotify not talking about Lossless for two years since announcing it. Spotify is instead shifted to trying to distract as much user listening time away from music and onto Podcasts, where at least they only need to pay for infrastructure costs rather than needing to pay royalties.\\n\\nI personally think that Apple Music is better at being a place to listen to music now than Spotify, but I don't think it's better in ways that actually matter to most people, not to the extent that they would leave Spotify for Apple Music and work to rebuild their libraries on a new platform.\",\n",
       " \"Spotify's Music organisation , Track discovery, App development, web api is 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors. \\n\\nShame they lost the high end audio race, they invested incorrectly in dumb podcasts and other social/lyric features. They havent figured out the diff between bot requests and real people requests and competitors creating posts to make it look that thats what people want. Or maybe they do know and instead want to bump up apples share price as form of payment to the US for using their internet . Anyway people like me figure out who the best is and end up there.\",\n",
       " \"If I don't own or use any apple devices, why would I want to use an apple service?\\n\\nSpotify works on all my devices, it knows which device is playing if I'm  signed on to more than one at a time, but let's me control from either. \\n\\nMost importantly, although I have the family plan, it has a free tier, so my friends who don't want to or can't afford to pay can use it and we can still easily share between each other.\",\n",
       " 'I have no clue what Apple sing is, so why/how could that influence my decision as well as the millions others who haven\\'t heard of it, too? \\n\\nAlso, how has Apple been aggressive? The only thing that comes to mind is podcasts. I have a notion Apple pays podcasters to plug Apple Music in their content. I always hears, \"Listen on Apple Music, Audible, or...wherever else you get your podcasts.\" Why do they never mention Spotify, the largest streaming music service?',\n",
       " 'Spotify never put a shitty U2 album in my library.',\n",
       " 'Apple deletes any local music on your computer that you put on it. Spotify just reads and reproduces your files digitally',\n",

       " \"So I've jumped between nearly every music service and can safely say Spotify is the best.\\n\\nFirst of all, they offer a super reliable smooth UI that just makes sense. Its really good, I love it.\\n\\nSecond of all, the music quality seems bad, but 320Kbps is honestly really decent. Tidal is awesome for music quality and there is a night and day difference, but Tidal also colors the audio which I hate.\\n\\nFinally, the price is really fair IMO. It's not any more than other services (that offer a similar or inferior experience). Also Apple Music is very tied into the Apple Ecosystem, so good luck enjoying it on anything other than an iPhone.\",\n",
